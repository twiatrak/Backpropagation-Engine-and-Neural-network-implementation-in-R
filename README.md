# Neural Network Backpropagation Engine

This repository contains an implementation of a backpropagation engine for neural networks in R, alongside a neural network script. It includes the following main files:

- `FinalBackpropagationEngine.R`: The core engine for implementing backpropagation in a neural network.
- `nn.R`: A script that defines the neural network structure and includes utilities for training and evaluating the network.

## Overview
This project implements a neural network and a backpropagation engine using R. It is designed for educational purposes and to demonstrate the basic principles of training a neural network through backpropagation.

## Features
- **Backpropagation**: Implements the backpropagation algorithm for training a neural network.
- **Custom Neural Network**: Allows users to define the structure of a neural network.
- **Performance Tracking**: Can track and visualize the performance metrics during training.


## Installation
